## About me

I'm a PhD student at Macquarie University in Sydney, currently working on research investigating educational inequality in Australia.

However, this blog will largely be a space for me to write about things that I work on in my spare time - and the topics covered will be quite wide-ranging.

As the year comes to an end, and I find myself with more time, I am considering my health and fitness more than I have for some time. As a result, some of the first few articles will be based on some health/fitness data.
